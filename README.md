## Dev Notes

### 2023/08/17

- slight issue with nav links... sveltekit or chrome or smth keeps track of last know position,
  so the #id thing flashes for a second...
- attempting to use github's fonts -> https://github.com/mona-sans
- using pre-rendering instead of ssr because i don't need to change much on here compared to the tinovation website
  - honestly not too much of a difference tho, just the tinovation website will be a tad slower in comparison
