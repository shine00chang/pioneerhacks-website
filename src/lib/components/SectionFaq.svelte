Who can participate?
Any high school student can participate. If you've graduated from high school, you can't participate, but you can come help mentor others.

How do I form or join a team?
You can form your own team of four, or you can join us at a team mixer at the beginning of the hackathon and meet others to form a team. Each team may have a maximum of four people.

Does this cost money?

Is there a code of conduct?

Do you offer travel reimbursements?

What should I bring?

What if I have dietary restrictions?
No problem! If you have dietary restrictions, simply add them to your application when you sign up, and we will accommodate for you! Additionally, each meal will have vegan, gluten free, and vegetarian options for everyone.

What if I can't code?
